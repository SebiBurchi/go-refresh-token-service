This is a service that simulates generating an access/refresh token pair, when a user is trying to login.

Running the application requires the existence of a redis instance on the working machine.
    - To run redis in a docker, from the working directory you can run the command: make redis

There is also a configuration file, config.yaml, where you can set information about the redis instance, 
but also about the user who will try to log in to the application
    - Please be sure that the configuration file contains correct information

If the above steps have been passed successfully, the application can be run using the command: make all

To run the tests and see the coverage, please run: make test
    - Running the tests will delete the existing entries in redis
